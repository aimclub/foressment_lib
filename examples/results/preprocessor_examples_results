TITANIC EXAMPLE
===================
START ANALYSIS OF DATA TYPES (N of substr[num,cat]=[2,3], max_cat=10, priority[manual,substring,unique,float]=[0.5,1,1,0.3])
     PassengerId with FEATURE_type=cat is incorrect. Changing to num (num=1.0,cat=0.8).
     SibSp with FEATURE_type=None is incorrect. Changing to cat (num=0.0,cat=1.3).
     Parch with FEATURE_type=None is incorrect. Changing to cat (num=0.0,cat=1.3).
     Fare with LABEL_type=None is incorrect. Changing to num(num=1.0,cat=0.3).
ANALYSIS OF DATA TYPES IS COMPLETE
START CLUSTER FILLING (fill_method=mean_mode, n_clusters=10, max_iter=5)
     iteration 0, fill 177 NaNs
     iteration 1, fill 177 NaNs
     iteration 2, fill 177 NaNs
     iteration 3, fill 177 NaNs
     => conversged on iteration 3
DONE CLUSTER FILLING
START INFORMATIVITY ANALYSIS
NO UNINFORMATIVE FEATURES
START MULTICOLINEARITY ANALYSIS
     delete feature=SibSp as it correlates with feature=PassengerId
     delete feature=Age as it correlates with feature=Pclass
REMOVE MILTICOLINEAR FEATURES: [Age, SibSp]

START INFORMATIVITY ANALYSIS
     gender is uninformative, can predict 1, while required 2
     price is uninformative, can predict 1, while required 3
REMOVE UNINFORMATIVE FEATURES: [gender, price]
START MULTICOLINEARITY ANALYSIS
     delete feature=age as it correlates with feature=name
REMOVE MILTICOLINEAR FEATURES: [age]
